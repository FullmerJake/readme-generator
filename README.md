  After looking through and studying Node.js, and having a horrible time on my own writing ReadMes, I was urged to create a program of my own that would take in data, and then output it into the correct MarkDown format. After a little bit of work, here it is!

  ## Installation
  In order to get this application to work you must first copy the repo from my github accout. If you are looking at this ReadMe, you've already gotten that far. Next make sure that you have Node.js installed on your computer. Once you've pulled up the application in your text editor of choice, pull up the command terminal. Type "Node Index" and you will be prompted with various questions. Answer each one and once you have completed that, the application will have created a ReadMe in the dist folder! Use it to your heart's content. 

  ## Usage
  This application is actually very simple. Open up your commandline prompter (bash for Windows, Terminal for Mac) and navigate to the folder you've placed the application in. Once there, type "Node Index" into the command line and answer the questions as prompted. Simple and Easy!

  ## Contribution
  As of right now, it is a very simple thing. But if you would like to expand upon it, you are welcome to do so! Fork this repo and make your changes! Some features that would be very helpful to the application would be the ability to add pictures and video to the test sections. An actual UI would also work really well so that those who aren't as Tech Savy would be able to use it without having to use the command line. If there are any other sections or questions that would be helpful in a ReadMe, by all means! Please Add them!

  ## Tests
  This ReadMe IS the test example! It was created purely in the command line, and purly by this very application!
